Tutoria is proudly powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)<sup>®</sup>.

- Anonymous Review

- Dedicated Admin/Staff Site for Easy Management.

- Begin/End Session Automation


## Installation

Before installation, you should have a working `django` copy. To obtain one,
you may visit [Django's website](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

First, clone this repo using `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/li-boxuan/tutoria.git

Then migrate the models. We provide a `Makefile` for automating
this process. To make a clean build, issue

    cd tutoria && make rebuild_empty

Or you can populate some demo data:

    cd tutoria && make rebuild
    
Afterwards, you can runserver and launch the application
via `localhost`:

    python manage.py runserver

Note that `begin_all_sessions` & `end_all_sessions` are implemented in the `scheduler_trigger.py`.
You need to begin/end all sessions using `scheduler_trigger` via Django shell:

    python manage.py shell
    from scheduler_trigger import *
    help() # see usage description

In the django shell, you can start all session at a specific time making use of `scheduler_trigger`:

    run(True, "Nov 25 2017, 9:00p.m.") # start all sessions

or end all session:

    run(False, "Nov 25 2017, 9:00p.m.") # end all sessions

For your convenience, you can let the scheduler do begin/end all sessions in turn within a time range:

    run_range("Nov 25 2017, 8:00a.m.", "Nov 26 2017, 9:00p.m.") # start & end all sessions in turn
